## Updating Llama Stack

If you wish to try new changes with Llama Stack, you can build your own image using the `Containerfile` in the root of this repository.

## Using With Lightspeed Core

Latest Lightspeed Core developer image:
```
quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest
```

To run Lightspeed Core (Llama Stack should be running):
```
podman run -it -p 8080:8080 -v lightspeed-stack.yaml:/app-root/lightspeed-stack.yaml:Z quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:dev-latest
```

**Note:** If you have built your own version of Lightspeed Core you can replace the image referenced with your own build. Additionally, you can use the Llama Stack container along with the `lightspeed-stack.yaml` file to run Lightspeed Core locally with `uv` from their [repository](https://github.com/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack).
